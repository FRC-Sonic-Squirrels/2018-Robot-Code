Quote from Doctor Who, Castrovalva Pt. 1
"
TEGAN: Will it tell us how to fly the Tardis?

NYSSA: I'm sure that's in here somewhere, once we find the index file.

TEGAN: How do we find the index file? Of course, if we had an index file, we could look it up in the index file, under index file. What am I saying? I'm talking nonsense.

NYSSA: Recursion isn't nonsense.

TEGAN: Eh?

NYSSA: That's an example of recursion, when procedures fold back on themselves. If you had an index file, you could look it up in the index file.

TEGAN: If. My Dad used to say that if was the most powerful word in the English language.

NYSSA: Recursionâ€™s a powerful mathematical concept, but I don't see how it can help us now.

TEGAN: If. I F! Stands for index file!
